Asteroid Warp Field

Open `index.html` in a browser to view the animation.

Controls:
- Speed: base forward speed of particles
- Warp Intensity: how dramatic the perspective warp is
- Density: number of particles (higher = more asteroids)
- Particle Size: base size multiplier

Tip: Press Space to toggle a stronger warp (good for a "jump" effect).

No build step required — just open the file in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
